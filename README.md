I'm learning C++ recently, have been using Java for years, and also use python for various smaller tasks.

I'm into game development and graphical programming, I've made my own game engine in Java+OpenGL, and now I'm (trying to) rewrite it in C++.

I also mod existing games, like Minecraft (vulkan07/Mortisomnia, an experimental horror mod)

I also host www.ezamedia.hu, a joke website with stupid content, but a great opportunity to learn frontend+backend development. No frameworks >:)

I'm planning a web-based timetable system that would make a better interface of my school's goofy substitution site.

I'm also a fan of embedded systems, assembly, microcontrollers, studying them bit by bit..
